# Physics-Aware Perception Diagnostics for AV Safety

This repository presents a diagnostic testing framework for autonomous vehicles that uses physics-based constraints to identify perception failures earlier, more reliably, and without ground truth labels.

Originally developed for a safety-critical initiative at Cruise, this method aims for:
- Subsystem-level error detection
- Long-tail risk discovery
- Test signal amplification
- 100% automation with zero triage

## 📂 Contents
- `Rick Hudson History and Prior Work Presentation.pdf` – Public-facing version of the presentation

## 🎯 Highlights
- 5× improvement in long-tail road issue detection
- Eliminated triage in use case testing
- Scaled to new operating conditions (higher speed, additional critical objects or constraints)

## ⚠️ Notes
Physics validator was work I led and implemeted with the ever-patient and detail oriented Mikhail Breslav.
